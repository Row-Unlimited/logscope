LogScope is a Python program for analyzing logs by checking them against log pattern specifications. The specification language is flexible, powerful and easy to use.

Logs can for example be generated from a running software system. LogScope assumes that logs are on a special form: Python sequences of events, where an event is a Python dictionary, mapping field names to values. It should be easy to convert any log file format to this format by writing a log converter (in Python for example).

Logscope was developed around 2008-2009 for the MSL FIT team,
and was used for a period. The work received JPL's internal Mariner Award in August 2009.

## Installation

Download the whl file from the release page and execute the following command to install it:

```shell
pip install ./logscope-*.whl
```

## Running LogScope

To run LogScope on an example, do the following:

```shell
cd examples/example1
python script.py
```

The results will be stored in the `results` directory local to the example, as well as being printed on std out.

## An Example Temporal Pattern Specification:</b>

The following specification states that if the log contains a flight software `COMMAND` event, with a name `x`, and a time stamp `begin_time`, then eventually an `EVR` event should occur within 100 time units, and there should be no failure event in between.

```
pattern P :
  COMMAND{Type: "FlightSoftWare", Name: x, Time : begin_time} => 
    [
       EVR{Name : x, Status : "dispatch"}, 
     ! EVR{Name : x, Status : s} where contains(s,"failure"), 
       EVR{Name : x, Status : "success", Time : end_time} 
         where |end_time-begin_time < 100| 
    ]
```

This specification is illustrated by the following timeline:

## An Example Automaton Specification

The same property can also be stated in the lower level automaton language into which the temporal patterns are mapped. 

```
 automaton A {
  always S1 {
    COMMAND{Type : "FlightSoftWare",Name : x,Time : begin_time} => S2(x,begin_time)
  }

  hot state S2(x,begin_time) {
    EVR{,Name : x, Status : "dispatch"} => S3(x,begin_time)
  }

  hot state S3(x,begin_time) {
    EVR{Name : x, Status : s} where contains(s, "failure") => error
    EVR{Name : x, Status : "success",Time : end_time} 
       where |end_time-begin_time < 100| => done
  }
}
```
Such automata is visualized by the tool as follows:

## An Example Python Script

The following Python script (example 1 in distribution) creates a log of 3 events and checks it against the specification P above:

```
import lsm.lsm as lsm

log = [
          {"OBJ_TYPE" : "COMMAND", "Type" : "FlightSoftWare", "Name" : "PICT", "Time" : 1900},
          {"OBJ_TYPE" : "EVR", "Name" : "PICT", "Status" : "dispatch"},
          {"OBJ_TYPE" : "EVR", "Name" : "PICT", "Status" : "success", "Time" : 2950}        
       ]
           
lsm.setResultDir("results")   
observer = lsm.Observer("spec")
observer.monitor(log)
```

## Result of Analyis

As a result of the analysis a result report is generated, listing all errors found.

```

       RESULTS FOR P:
============================

Errors: 1

*** violated: in hot end state:

  state S3(x,begin_time) {
    EVR{Status : s,Name : x} where contains(s, "failure") => error
    EVR{Status : "success",Name : x,Time : end_time} 
      where |end_time-begin_time < 100| => S4(x,begin_time,end_time)
  }
  with bindings: {'x': 'PICT', 'begin_time': 1900}

--- error trace: ---
